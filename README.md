# retree

A library of functional combinators for strategy-based tree-rewriting.

Retree is a Clojure port of the rewrite combinators in [Kiama](
https://code.google.com/p/kiama/), a Scala library for language processing.
Kiama's rewrite combinators are, in turn, an adaption of [Stratego](
http://strategoxt.org/), a language for program transformations.

## Usage

Don't use this library yet. It's very far from finished...

I'll write lots more soon!
